# Restore from backup-2025-08-11

This document explains how to restore your project from the `backup-2025-08-11` branch on GitHub.

---

## Method 1: Full rollback (replace current state)
**âš  Warning:** This will overwrite your current branch with the backup version.

```bash
# Switch to backup branch
git checkout backup-2025-08-11

# OR reset your current branch (e.g., main) to the backup
git checkout main
git reset --hard backup-2025-08-11

# Push changes to GitHub (force overwrite)
git push origin main --force
```

---

## Method 2: Restore only files (keep current commit history)
Use this if you just want to restore files but keep your branch's commit history.

```bash
# Checkout files from backup into current branch
git checkout backup-2025-08-11 -- .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Restore files from backup-2025-08-11"
git push origin main
```

---

## Notes
- Always ensure you have saved any local changes before running these commands.
- Method 1 is destructive (it will remove commits made after the backup).
- Method 2 is safer and recommended if you are not sure.
